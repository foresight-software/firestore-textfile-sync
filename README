# Firestore Text File Sync

## Motivation

This component was created to solve a specific integration challenge: connecting a legacy system with Firestore without requiring major system upgrades or dependency changes. The legacy system can be modified but cannot have its dependencies upgraded, making direct Firestore integration problematic.

## Solution

Firestore Text File Sync acts as a bridge between Firestore and a local text file system. It provides a lightweight, efficient way to synchronize data between Firestore and local text files, which can be easily parsed by the legacy system without requiring special code or dependencies.

## Features

### 1. Firestore to CSV Sync
- Listens to a specified Firestore collection
- Reacts to new documents being created
- Appends new data to a configured CSV file
- Minimal latency due to simple CSV parsing
- Uses a simple configuration file for setup

### 2. CSV to Firestore Upload
- Monitors specified CSV files for changes
- Detects new lines being appended
- Uploads new data to corresponding Firestore documents

## Benefits

- **Minimal System Impact**: Uses CSV format that can be easily parsed
- **Flexible Integration**: Can be implemented without major system changes
- **Low Latency**: CSV file operations are fast and efficient
- **Simple Maintenance**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Future-Proof**: Can be extended to support other file formats in the future
